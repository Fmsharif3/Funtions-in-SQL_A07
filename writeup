Functions

ntroduction

In this paper I will be going over SQL User Defined Functions while also discussing the similarities 
and differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

SQL UDF

SQL User Defined Function (UDF) allows users to create reusable functions. After a user has created a UDF
they are able to reference it in queries or when creating views. Some commonly used SQL UDF are Scalar, Inline, 
and Multi-Statement Functions.

Differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions

When working with Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions you’ll notice there are a few differences and 
similarities between the three Functions. Both Inline and Multi-Statement Functions return tables, while Scalar 
functions returns a single value of the type defined in the RETURNS clause. Inline and Multi-Statement Functions 
both return tables but the structure of these functions are different. Multi-Statement Functions has a return table 
variable whereas Inline Functions doesn’t.
